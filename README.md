This program is a simple number guessing game. It prompts the user to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range. If the user's guess is incorrect, the program provides hints to guess higher or lower. Once the user guesses the correct number, the program displays the number of guesses it took. The user has the option to play again or quit. The program uses loops and conditional statements to manage the game logic and user interaction.
